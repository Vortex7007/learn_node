// it is a immediately invoked function . i.e when we uses a simple code then it gets wrapped by a function by nodde js
(function(exports , require, module, __filename,__dirname){
    const name="anshu";
    console.log(name);
    // console.log(__filename);
})();//all the exports , requires and exports are exclusive to this file and that's why we can ue it anywhere
